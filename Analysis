**Overview of the analysis:** Create a model that can predict if applicants will be successful with their ventures.

**Results:** 
- Data Preprocessing
  - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? IS_SUCCESSFUL is the target
  - What variable(s) are the features for your model? The following are the features for the model: 
               NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
  - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? EIN should be removed.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- The final model used three hidden layers, 15, 30, and 45 nodes, and relu and sigmoid functions.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- yes, the final model had a 75% accuracy.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
- In the first model, I trialed multiple combinations of nodes in 3 or 4 hidden layers:
  - nodes to 10, 20, 30, 40 (accuracy: 72.83)
  - nodes: 40, 20, 30, 40 (accuracy: 72.98)
  - nodes: 10, 20, 30, 40 (accuracy: 72.66)
  - nodes: 20, 30, 40, 50 (accuracy: 73.03)
  - nodes: 10, 20, 30 (accuracy 73)
  - nodes: 15, 30, 45 (accuracy 72.75)
- In the second model, I used 4 layers using nodes 20, 30, 40, 50 and adjusted the number of classification binning to values
  - <100 (accuracy: 72.84)
  - <50 (accuracy: 73.1)

**Summary:**  In the final model, I used the most successful node + layer combination run. What allowed the final model to achieve a greater than 75% accuracy was including and binning the NAME feature.
